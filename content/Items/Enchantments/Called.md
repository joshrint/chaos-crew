A called weapon can be teleported to the wielder’s hand as a Bonus Action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the weapon is in the possession of another creature. This ability has a maximum range of 100 feet, and effects that block teleportation prevent the return of a called weapon. A called weapon must be in a creature’s possession for at least 24 hours for this ability to function
