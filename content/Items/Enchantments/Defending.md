## Effect
A defending weapon allows the wielder to transfer some or all of the weapon’s enhancement bonus to their AC as a bonus that stacks with all others. As a free action, the wielder chooses how to allocate the weapon’s enhancement bonus at the start of his turn before using the weapon, and the bonus to AC lasts until his next turn. This ability can only be placed on melee weapons.
