_**Spellcasting.**_ The pledgemage casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 13):

At will: [guidance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/guidance), [light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/light)

2/day each: [comprehend languages](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/comprehend-languages), [locate object](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/locate-object)

1/day each: [mage armor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mage-armor), [speak with dead](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/speak-with-dead), [stone shape](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/stone-shape)

### Actions
_**Multiattack.**_ The pledgemage makes two Scroll Bash attacks.

_**Scroll Bash.** Melee Spell Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 8 (1d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) thunder damage.

_**Reduce to Memory (Recharge 6).**_ Thundering golden energy erupts around a creature the pledgemage can see within 90 feet of it. The creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking  (4d10) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Construct has disadvantage on the saving throw.

### Bonus Action
_**Chronal Break (1/Day).**_ The pledgemage chooses a point within 30 feet of itself, shunting the minds of nearby creatures out of this moment in time. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Incapacitated) until the end of the pledgemage’s next turn.

### Reactions
_**Learn from the Past (2/Day).**_ When another creature within 60 feet of the pledgemage misses a target with an attack roll, the pledgemage magically enables the attacker to reroll the attack roll. It must use the new roll.
